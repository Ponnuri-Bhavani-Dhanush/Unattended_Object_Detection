# Unattended Object Detection

## Introduction
Unattended Object Detection is a project that aims to detect unattended objects in a given area using image processing techniques. This project has been developed using various technologies like Python, Django, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, SQLite database, NumPy, OpenCV2, Twilio API, and SMTP.

## Dataset
We have used the ABODA dataset in this project for training and testing the model. This dataset is available online and can be downloaded from the internet.

## Starting the Server
To start the server, follow the below steps:
1. Make sure you have installed Python, Django, and all the necessary libraries.
2. Open the terminal/command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the command `python manage.py runserver` to start the server.
4. Open the web browser and go to the URL `http://localhost:8000/` to access the application.

## Usage
To use the Unattended Object Detection system, follow the below steps:
1. Open the web browser and go to the URL `http://localhost:8000/`.
2. Login to the site using admin credentials.
3. Enter the mobile number, email and select the video which you want to detect.
4. Click on the "Submit" button to start the object detection process.
5. The system will detect the unattended object and alert the user through email and SMS using the Twilio API.

## Conclusion
Unattended Object Detection is a powerful tool that can be used to detect and alert users about unattended objects in a given area. With the help of image processing and web development technologies, this project has been developed to provide an easy-to-use and efficient system for object detection.
